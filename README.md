- Creates daily CSV files
- Checks every minute, logs every 5+ minutes
- Works on reMarkable 2, Paper Pro, and Paper Pro Move
- Pure bash implementation

## Automatic Installation (Recommended)

> [!CAUTION]
> Piping code from the internet directly into `bash` can be dangerous. Make sure you trust the source and know what it will do to your system.

| Column | Unit | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| timestamp | ISO 8601 | Time of reading |
| capacity_percent | % | Battery level |
| charge_now_mah | mAh | Current charge |
| charge_full_mah | mAh | Full charge capacity |
| status | - | Charging/Discharging/Full |
| current_avg_ma | mA | Average current (negative = discharging) |
| voltage_v | V | Battery voltage |
| temp_c | Â°C | Battery temperature |
| brightness | 0-2047 | Frontlight level (0 on reMarkable 2) |

## Compensation to Match UI Values

The operating system reports different values from the reMarkable tablet UI.

**Paper Pro Move**
```
MIN(100, IF([capacity_percent]>=80, 1.1164*[capacity_percent]-9.363, 1.1904*[capacity_percent]-14.9555))
```
