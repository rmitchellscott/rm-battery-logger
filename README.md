Battery and frontlight monitoring for reMarkable tablets. Logs statistics to daily CSV files.

## Features

- Logs battery capacity, charge, voltage, current, temperature, and frontlight brightness
- Creates daily CSV files
- Checks every minute, logs every 5+ minutes
- Works on reMarkable 1, reMarkable 2, Paper Pro, and Paper Pro Move
- Pure bash implementation

## Automatic Installation (Recommended)

> [!CAUTION]
> Piping code from the internet directly into `bash` can be dangerous. Make sure you trust the source and know what it will do to your system.


```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmitchellscott/rm-battery-logger/main/install.sh | bash
```
Installs to `/home/root/rm-battery-logger`

## Manual Installation

```bash
cd /home/root
wget https://github.com/rmitchellscott/rm-battery-logger/releases/latest/download/rm-battery-logger.tar.gz
mkdir -p rm-battery-logger
tar -xzf rm-battery-logger.tar.gz -C rm-battery-logger
cd rm-battery-logger
chmod +x *.sh
./start.sh
```

## Usage

Start logging:
```bash
rm-battery-logger/start.sh
```

Stop logging:
```bash
rm-battery-logger/stop.sh
```

Check version:
```bash
rm-battery-logger/battery_logger.sh -v
```

## Log Format

Files are saved as `battery_log_YYYY-MM-DD.csv` in the installation directory.

### Columns

| Column | Unit | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| timestamp | ISO 8601 | Time of reading |
| capacity_percent | % | Battery level |
| charge_now_mah | mAh | Current charge |
| charge_full_mah | mAh | Full charge capacity |
| status | - | Charging/Discharging/Full |
| current_avg_ma | mA | Average current (negative = discharging) |
| voltage_v | V | Battery voltage |
| temp_c | Â°C | Battery temperature |
| brightness | 0-2047 | Frontlight level (0 on reMarkable 2) |

## Device Compatibility

| Device | Battery Controller | Frontlight |
|--------|--------------------|------------|
| reMarkable 1 | bq27441 | No |
| reMarkable 2 | max77818 | No |
| reMarkable Paper Pro | max1726x | Yes |
| reMarkable Paper Pro Move | max77818 | Yes |

Auto-detects battery controller at runtime.

## Compensation to Match UI Values

The operating system reports different values from the reMarkable tablet UI. I've used the following formulas when post-processing the data to compensate for this. 

Formulas are derived from me watching the UI and noting values compared to what the script reports at multiple points. They're likely not perfect, and may even differ across OS releases. These were recorded on 3.22.

**rM1 & rM2**
```
=MAX(0, MIN(100, IF([capacity_percent]>=50, 1.1054*[capacity_percent]-10.7743, 1.1458*[capacity_percent]-12.6034)))
```

**Paper Pro**
```
=MAX(0, MIN(100, IF([capacity_percent]>=75, 1.0968*[capacity_percent]-6.3763, 1.1981*[capacity_percent]-13.179)))
```

**Paper Pro Move**
```
=MAX(0, MIN(100, IF([capacity_percent]>=80, 1.1164*[capacity_percent]-9.363, 1.2040*[capacity_percent]-15.6514)))
```
